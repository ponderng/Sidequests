# About the box
Registry took me through several services that I've never used before, including one that I wanted to get to know better, Docker. The box begins with an online Docker registry available that's protected by easily guessable creds. After getting into the docker image, credentials are found that get SSH access for the user account. Using the SSH, enumerate the machine to find another service called "Bolt CMS" and figure out how to upload a webshell to get access to a second user. Then use another service "Restic Backup" to exfiltrate the root flag. Also, I explore a way to get root shell access.

# Initial Recon
## NMAP Scan
Using NMAP, scan the IP address with `nmap -n -sC -sV -Pn -p- -oN nmap.txt 10.10.10.159`. 
This sets the options:

* `-n` for no DNS lookup
* `-sC` for default scripts
* `-sV` for service version probing
* `-Pn` to skip ping check
* `-p-` for scan all ports
* and `-oN nmap.txt` for setting the output text file

The output we'll get is:

{% endhighlight %}

Analyzing this NMAP output, we see three ports that are open and their service versions. Keep notes about the services open and what their versions are. In this case, there is an Nginx web server operating on HTTP and HTTPS. The key takeaway here is the SSL-cert is showing the hostname in what must be a self-signed certificate, "docker.registry.htb". When finding new hostnames, add them to your "/etc/hosts" file because certain VirtualHosts will require exact hostnames for you to reach them.

## Enumerate docker.registry.htb
Use a web directory enumeration program like gobuster to find out some things that can be reached. As an experiment, I ran gobuster first against the IP address, and then against the hostname "docker.registry.htb". Only when using the hostname was I able to find anything interesting. Using just the IP address merely gave me the files for the default installation of Nginx.

The default installation files found with the IP address:

{% endhighlight %}

If we do some research on the page "/v2" and registry, we find out that it holds an API endpoint for docker-registry version 2. Since there doesn't seem to be anything else for initial enumeration, we can move on to getting into the docker-registry service.

# Attacking The Docker Registry
## Gaining access with docker run
To access the remote registry, we need to get the self-signed cert working right. Open the certificate in the web browser while on the "/v2" page and export it under "/etc/docker/certs.d/".

Then visit the page found "/v2" under "docker.registry.htb", and a login is presented.
![](\Sidequests\assets\registry\2020-03-07_21h13_16.png)

There isn't any special technique to getting past the login credentials for the docker.registry.htb/v2 page. Just some common guesses will lead you to `admin: admin`, which lets you use the service.

Reading the [docker API reference](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api/), we find listing repositories is done by simply visiting the page "/v2/_catalog". Trying it in the browser shows only one, "bolt-image".

We want to be able to download and run the image, so first fire up the docker service with `sudo service docker start` then use these steps:

1. To download the image, use the command `sudo docker pull docker.registry.htb/bolt-image`. 
2. After it's pulled, we will be able to see the image listed in our local images with `sudo docker images`. 
3. Copy the image id listed for bolt-image to use later. 
4. And finally, to use the image we have to run it and open a bash shell with `sudo docker run -it --rm 601499e98a60 /bin/bash`. The run command uses `-it` flag to specify that we want to use an interactive TTY shell, and `--rm` says to clean up the files used after we're done. Replace "601499e98a60" with the image id copied earlier.

## Enumerate bolt-image
We are root when we're dropped into the shell inside "bolt-image", so enumerating to figure out the next step should be easy.

There are some interesting files in the home directory. Using `ls -laR /root` shows a private SSH key and config. 

{% highlight plain_text %}
root@6c855edb286c:/# ls -laR /root
/root:

-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  743 May 25  2019 id_rsa.pub
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  444 May 25  2019 known_hosts
{% endhighlight %}

Read the SSH config file and you'll see another use of the hostname, this time it's just "registry.htb". We also see what user SSH is used with, "bolt". Make notes of the findings. Print out the SSH key and copy/paste it into a file on your box. Add "registry.htb" to your "/etc/hosts" file as well. 

{% highlight plain_text %}
root@6c855edb286c:~/.ssh# cat config
Host registry
  User bolt
  Port 22
  Hostname registry.htb
{% endhighlight %}

So with this, we should be able to log into the SSH service on port 22 of registry.htb. However, when trying to add the private key, we're presented with the passphrase request. Unfortunately, my password cracking tools weren't able to crack that passphrase, so avoid diving down that rabbit hole. 

{% highlight plain_text %}
~/htb/registry ᐅ ssh-add ./bolt_rsa
Enter passphrase for ./bolt_rsa: 
Bad passphrase, try again for ./bolt_rsa: 
{% endhighlight %}

To find the passphrase, go back to enumerating the bolt-image. There were some other files in the root directory we could look at. Most of the files are fairly standard, and the bash history going to "/dev/null" is normal for pentesting boxes. However, the ".viminfo" file is different. 

Print it out and you'll see two files that have been recently edited: "/var/www/html/sync.sh" and "/etc/profile.d/01-ssh.sh". 

{% highlight plain_text %}

Print them out and you'll see a hardcoded passphrase for the SSH key!

# SSH Bolt User Enumeration
After adding the SSH key with the passphrase found, we're able to login to "registry.htb" as "bolt". Use the command `ssh bolt@registry.htb` to get to the user shell, where the "user.txt" flag is found.

![](\Sidequests\assets\registry\2020-03-08_21h02_13.png)

After claiming the user flag, we need to find the next thing to exploit. There is no obvious enumeration finds that allow privilege escalation, like a "sudo -l" entry. Instead, look for the config files for Nginx, since we know that's the kind of web server the box is using. You can use the "find" program to look for it quickly.

{% highlight plain_text %}
bolt@bolt:~$ find /etc -name *nginx* 2>/dev/null
/etc/rc1.d/K01nginx
/etc/rc6.d/K01nginx
/etc/rc0.d/K01nginx
/etc/rc3.d/S01nginx
/etc/rc5.d/S01nginx
/etc/ufw/applications.d/nginx
/etc/rc4.d/S01nginx
/etc/default/nginx
/etc/init.d/nginx
/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/nginx.service
/etc/logrotate.d/nginx
/etc/rc2.d/S01nginx
/etc/nginx
/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
bolt@bolt:~$ 
{% endhighlight %}

## Parsing Nginx config files

The "nginx.conf" file links all config files under the "/etc/nginx/sites-enabled" as well. That's where you'll see which sites are on the box and their specific settings. There's a config file for the "docker.registry.htb" site that we already know about, and another one for "registry.htb". Look at that one to see more about it.

{% highlight plain_text %}
bolt@bolt:/etc/nginx/sites-enabled$ cat 01.registry.conf 
server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    listen 443 ssl;
    include snippets/self-signed.conf;
    include snippets/ssl-params.conf;

    root /var/www/html;
    index index.php index.html; 

    server_name registry.htb;

    location = /bolt/app/database/bolt.db {
        deny all;
        return 404;
    }

    location = /bolt/bolt {
        try_files               $uri $uri/ /bolt/index.php?$query_string;
    }

    location ^~ /bolt/bolt/ {
        try_files                     $uri /bolt/index.php?$query_string;
    }

    location ^~ /bolt/(.*)$ {
        try_files               $uri $uri/ /bolt/index.php?$query_string;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.2-fpm.sock;
    }

    location ~ /\.ht {
        deny all;
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

That config file has details about a database called "bolt.db" and a URL location "/bolt/bolt". Open up your web browser and go to that location to find the Bolt app.

# Accessing Bolt App

It's usually good practice to try previously found credentials on new targets like this, but so far we don't have the right ones. Instead, continue the enumeration by looking into the other info found from the config file, "bolt.db". 

Using the `file` command to find out what kind of database it is, you'll see it's made with sqlite3. 

{% highlight console %}
bolt@bolt:/var/www/html/bolt/app/database$ file bolt.db
bolt.db: SQLite 3.x database, last written using SQLite version 3022000
{% endhighlight %}

Unfortunately, the box doesn't have the SQLite3 program installed so we can't directly open it from there, it has to first be copied out. One way to do that is by using Netcat.

There must be some firewall rules set up to drop outgoing connections because none of my attempts to send the file back the way I normally do it worked. So instead, it has to be done by setting up the listener on the remote box first.

`nc -lvnp 5555 < bolt.db`

And on your local machine use Netcat to connect to the listener, with it set up to save data sent to it as the database file.

`nc registry.htb 5555 > bolt.db`

Once you enter that command, it will connect and receive the database, then you'll just need to kill the connection and analyze the file!

## Analyzing bolt.db with sqlite3
Open the newly downloaded database file with `sqlite3 bolt.db`, and it will tell you to use ".help" for usage directions.

{% highlight console %}
~/htb/registry ᐅ sqlite3 bolt.db
SQLite version 3.31.1 2020-01-27 19:55:54
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite> 
{% endhighlight %}

To list out the tables, use the command `.tables`.

{% highlight console %}
sqlite> .tables
bolt_authtoken    bolt_field_value  bolt_pages        bolt_users      
bolt_blocks       bolt_homepage     bolt_relations  
bolt_cron         bolt_log_change   bolt_showcases  
bolt_entries      bolt_log_system   bolt_taxonomy 
{% endhighlight %}

Any table with "users" in the name is usually good for enumeration, so dump that table with the SQL query `select * from bolt_users`.

{% highlight SQL %}
sqlite> select * from bolt_users;
1|admin|$2y$10$e.ChUytg9SrL7AsboF2bX.wWKQ1LkS5Fi3/Z0yYD86.P5E9cpY7PK|bolt@registry.htb|2020-03-09 03:46:01|10.10.15.237|Admin|["files://leax.php"]|1||||0||["root","everyone"]
sqlite> 
{% endhighlight %}

It looks like there is a user "admin" and a password hash in the record. Use whichever is your favorite password cracker for this, mine is John The Ripper.

## Bolt user credential cracking with John The Ripper
Start by copying the hash into a text file. Then use the command to call john on it with `john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt bolt.admin.hash`.

{% highlight console %}
~/htb/registry ᐅ sudo john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt bolt.admin.hash

Turns out the password is cracked right away as "strawberry". Just use "admin" and "strawberry" to login at the prompt on the app page.

# Bolt App Hacking
It turns out that there is a way to upload some files at two places in the app, both are options under "File Management".
[![File Upload Capabilities](\Sidequests\assets\registry\2020-03-16_22h07_10.png)](\Sidequests\assets\registry\2020-03-16_22h07_10.png)

If we test both upload points, we will notice that files sent via the regular **Uploaded Files** section only stay for a minute or so before being deleted. However, if we send files via the **View/edit Templates** section, it will stay until the box is reset. So only use the **View/edit Templates** method of file upload.

Unfortunately, the file upload doesn't allow PHP files. However, there's a [CVE](https://vuln.whitesourcesoftware.com/vulnerability/CVE-2019-9185/) on the version used that says extensions for file uploads can be changed to PHP. See the following screenshot taken after attempting a PHP file upload.
[![PHP File Type Error](\Sidequests\assets\registry\2020-03-16_22h09_13.png)](\Sidequests\assets\registry\2020-03-16_22h09_13.png)

Also, there is a configuration file that defines which file types are allowed and which aren't. The config file can be found at "Configuration -> Main Configuration"
[![Main Configuration](\Sidequests\assets\registry\2020-03-16_22h20_39.png)](\Sidequests\assets\registry\2020-03-16_22h20_39.png)

It says that PHP files are never allowed even if they are within the list, but for some reason, that's not true in this case. If you can change the list, you can upload PHP files. 
[![Accepted File Types](\Sidequests\assets\registry\2020-03-16_22h17_00.png)](\Sidequests\assets\registry\2020-03-16_22h17_00.png)

## Editing the main config file and exploiting a race condition
The configuration file can be changed from the Bolt dashboard, but it is almost immediately reverted back to its original state. This can be noticed by looking at the directory listing before and after saving the file. And if we look back at the config file, any changes made will have disappeared.

Before:
[![Before](\Sidequests\assets\registry\2020-03-17_20h05_21.png)](\Sidequests\assets\registry\2020-03-17_20h05_21.png)

After:
[![After](\Sidequests\assets\registry\2020-03-17_20h08_40.png)](\Sidequests\assets\registry\2020-03-17_20h08_40.png)

Since the file can be changed at least momentarily, a race condition can be exploited to change the accepted file types and then upload a webshell before the config is reverted back. One way to do that is by writing a script that goes through the steps of saving the config and uploading a file in a fraction of a second. 

> **Note:** Check out the source code for my version of this script on [github](\Sidequests\assets\registry\savephp.py). Notice that it involves CSRF tokens for everything, so those have to be extracted before making the API calls.

## Uploading and using a webshell for enumeration
Once we have the upload script working, use it to send your favorite PHP webshell, then browse to it or click on it from the dashboard.
